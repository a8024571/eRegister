=========

An attendance register system

This project is my first portfolio entry for the SHU web architectures module.

This project is for an assignment in the web architectures module at Sheffield Hallam university.

Throughout this application I have made use of:
 
  •Configuration management
  •Domain modelling
  •Controller development

###Running the project
       
First of all, make sure you have some Visualisation software ready to clone the project, I have used VMWARE 9 in this instance.
You will also need a Debain image with the tools installed:  java 7, MYSQL, Grails, git ..

Now that you have the image running, you are ready to clone the project directly from github.  Use this command line to clone the project:
git clone git@github.com:a8024571/eRegister.git

You now have a project called 'eRegister' on your local network and can be accessed whenever you want.

###What I learned
This particular module has been a real learning experience for me and has helped me understand the fundementals of web architertures as a whole.  This particular project was very challeging but yet very rewarding for future projects to come.  
The most enjoyable experience I had with this project was creating the relationships between the created classes and editing the different groovy files.  I also enjoyed the implementatiopn of the views of the project since I personally like creating the look and feel of websites.
